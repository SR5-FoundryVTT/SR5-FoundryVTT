## This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
#
name: build

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ development ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: npm ci

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: gulp build
      - uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v4 # You can change this to use a specific version
        with:
          # The arguments for the `git add` command (see the paragraph below for more info)
          # Default: '.'
          add: 'dist'

          # The message for the commit
          # Default: 'Commit from GitHub Actions'
          message: 'Automatic build of bundle'

        env:
          # This is necessary in order to push a commit to the repo
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Leave this line unchanged
