# Shadowrun5e for Foundry Virtual Tabletop
[Manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SR5-FoundryVTT/SR5-FoundryVTT/master/system.json)

Come on the FoundryVTT discord shadowrun5e channel and have a chat. :)

We will always be happy to look at a Pull Request if there are features or bugs you'd like to work on.

Should you need an older version you can check [releases](https://github.com/SR5-FoundryVTT/SR5-FoundryVTT/releases) and reference the system.json on each release instead of FoundryVTTs system marketplace.
