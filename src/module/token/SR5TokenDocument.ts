     *
     * This method gets called many times, both when the user is measuring and while the token is actually moving.
     * The bulk of the token movement logic happens in TokenDocument#_preUpdate and specifically in
     * TokenDocument##preUpdateMovement.
     * The private property SR5TokenDocument##movementInProgress is used to track if a user is currently measuring and planning
     * a move or if the move is actually in progress.
     * While a move is in progress we skip assigning movement actions, because this method gets called with multiple
     * different sections of the route depending on the progress of the movement.
     * This makes it impossible to accurately assign the correct movement action, causing the measured route on
     * screen to rapidly change colors as sections get closer to the token.
